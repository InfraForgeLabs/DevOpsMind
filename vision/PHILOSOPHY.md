### 🤖 **Position on AI Integration — DevOpsMind**

DevOpsMind’s approach to learning is that **intelligence should guide, not control.**

AI operates **offline by default**, with optional online parsing for documentation or challenge content when enabled by the user.
Everything remains aligned with the **Free · Local · Open · Forever** principle.

From **v3.0.0 onward**, Ember becomes DevOpsMind’s **local learning intelligence**, providing adaptive hints, skill analytics, and reasoning feedback.

Planned enhancements include:

* Personalized challenge paths & adaptive hints
* Local analytics & progress insights
* **Optional online lookup** for DevOps docs, CVE feeds, or tutorials when allowed by policy

All **offline-first, explainable, and privacy-safe.**
DevOpsMind will **never depend on remote AI services** to function.
